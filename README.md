# ably-server

[![CI](https://github.com/ably/ably-server/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ably/ably-server/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A single-binary, [Ably](https://ably.com)-compatible server. Speaks Ably's
realtime WebSocket protocol and the core REST pub/sub endpoints, so
existing Ably client SDKs can connect with only a host/port override.

This is work in progress; see [Status](#status) below.

## Why this exists

Ably's cloud is the production answer for realtime messaging, but there
are situations where running a local, self-contained server is more
convenient:

- **Local development** — no internet, no shared sandbox app, no shared
  rate limits. Point your SDK at `localhost` and go.
- **CI** — a deterministic, disposable broker spun up per test run.
- **Self-hosting** — single-region deployments where the operator does
  not need (or want) Ably's cloud.

The goal is "drop-in for the use cases above": the SDK doesn't change,
only the endpoint does.

## How it works

One Go binary, three storage modes selected by `--mode`:

| Mode      | State          | Pub/sub      | Use case                          |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| `memory`  | in-process     | in-process   | tests, local dev, ephemeral       |
| `disk`    | embedded KV    | in-process   | single-node with persistence      |
| `cluster` | Postgres       | `LISTEN/NOTIFY` on one channel (`--bus=pgnotify`, the default) | N stateless nodes, shared DB   |
| `cluster` + `--bus=postgres` | Postgres | per-channel `LISTEN`, coalesced wake-ups by default | N stateless nodes, shared DB, no other dependency |
| `cluster` + `--bus=nats` | Postgres | NATS core pub/sub | N stateless nodes, shared DB, a NATS server or cluster carries cross-node delivery |

In every cluster mode Postgres is the store and orders each channel;
`--bus` only chooses how a committed message reaches the other nodes
([DESIGN.md §7.2](DESIGN.md#72-cluster-bus)).

Server processes are stateless: any node can serve any connection.
There's no peer-to-peer membership or gossip — in `cluster` mode, the
database is the coordination point.

Surface area (subset of Ably's protocol — see [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for
the full spec):

- **WebSocket** at `GET /` — `ATTACH` / `DETACH` / `MESSAGE` with
  `channelSerial`-based attachment continuity and `rewind`.
- **REST** — `POST/GET /channels/{name}/messages`,
  `GET /channels/{name}/presence[/history]`, `GET /time`,
  `GET /healthz`, `GET /readyz`.
- **Presence** — enter/update/leave, sync on attach, presence history.
- **Mutable messages** — message update/delete/append with version history.
- **Auth** — API key (Basic) or JWT (HS256) with Ably-style capabilities.

Out of scope: push, integrations, multi-region, Spaces, Chat,
LiveObjects, and the rest of the cloud-only product surface.

## Quickstart

Requires Go 1.26+.

```sh
# Pick any key in the Ably format: <appId>.<keyId>:<secret>
export ABLY_SERVER_KEYS=app.key:secret

go run ./cmd/ably-server --listen :8080
```

Publish via REST:

```sh
curl -u "$ABLY_SERVER_KEYS" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"greeting","data":"hello"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/channels/test/messages
```

Connect with an Ably SDK by pointing it at the local host:

```go
client, _ := ably.NewRealtime(
    ably.WithKey("app.key:secret"),
    ably.WithRealtimeHost("localhost"),
    ably.WithEnvironment(""),
    ably.WithPort(8080),
    ably.WithTLS(false),
)
```

### Modes

```sh
# In-memory (default)
ably-server --mode memory

# On-disk (bbolt) persistence
ably-server --mode disk --data-dir ./data

# Clustered against Postgres
export ABLY_SERVER_POSTGRES_DSN='postgres://user:pw@host:5432/db?sslmode=disable'
ably-server --mode cluster

# Clustered, with the rebuilt Postgres bus (no extra dependency)
ably-server --mode cluster --bus postgres

# Clustered, with NATS as the cross-node bus (Postgres stays the store)
ably-server --mode cluster --bus nats --nats-url nats://nats1:4222,nats://nats2:4222,nats://nats3:4222
```

`bench/` has a three-node compose stack per bus, each on its own ports
so they can run side by side: `docker-compose.pgnotify.yml` (nodes on
8381-8383), `docker-compose.postgres.yml` (8281-8283) and
`docker-compose.nats.yml` (8181-8183, with a three-server NATS
cluster). `bench/compose-smoke.sh <bus>` brings one up, publishes on
node 1, reads it back from node 3 and tears it down.

Run `ably-server --help` for the full flag list. Every option can also be
set in a TOML config file passed via `--config`; see
[`config.example.toml`](./config.example.toml) for every key documented
with its default.

### Local cluster (Docker Compose)

To run the full `cluster` topology locally — one PostgreSQL instance and
three stateless ably-server nodes sharing it for both state and pub/sub:

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

The nodes auto-migrate the empty database on boot (under a Postgres
advisory lock), so there's no manual setup. Cluster mode needs
PostgreSQL 14 or later. Each node is reachable on its
own host port and all three share the key `app.key:secret`, so a
client can attach to any of them:

| Node  | Endpoint              |
|-------|-----------------------|
| node1 | `http://localhost:8081` |
| node2 | `http://localhost:8082` |
| node3 | `http://localhost:8083` |

Publish to one node and read it back from another (the shared DB carries
the message across):

```sh
curl -u app.key:secret -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"greeting","data":"hello"}' \
  http://localhost:8081/channels/test/messages

curl -u app.key:secret http://localhost:8082/channels/test/history
```

## Benchmarking

`cmd/ably-bench` drives pub/sub load against a running server (a single
node or the Compose cluster above), checks delivery correctness, measures
end-to-end latency, and can search for the highest throughput that stays
within a latency budget.

```sh
# Fixed-rate run against the local cluster (default endpoints):
go run ./cmd/ably-bench --rate 5000 --duration 10s

# Find the max throughput within p50<=20ms, p99<=100ms:
go run ./cmd/ably-bench --search --p50 20ms --p99 100ms --max-rate 100000

# Target a single in-memory node instead:
go run ./cmd/ably-bench --endpoints localhost:8090 --rate 20000
```

Each message carries its publisher id, a per-publisher sequence number,
and a publish timestamp; the same process publishes and subscribes, so
latency is measured against one clock with no skew. Correctness is a hard
check — any loss, duplication, or per-channel reordering fails the run.
`--search` ramps the offered load until the budget breaks, then binary-
searches for the highest sustained rate that still meets it. Run
`go run ./cmd/ably-bench --help` for the full flag list.

Three things matter for throughput runs. Each publisher connection runs
its publishes one at a time, so `--publishers` (default 4) caps the rate
at that many over the publish latency; raise it. With many publishers,
pass `--stagger` so their first sends are spread across one publish
interval instead of arriving as one burst per interval. The warm-up
(`--warmup`) starts only once every client is connected and attached
(publishers attach explicitly), so the setup transient never lands in the
measured window.

For cluster-scale load (hundreds of thousands of connections, REST
publishers, serial-continuity checking on a channel sample, one-way
latency across nodes), see `cmd/ably-loadgen` and `cmd/ably-conductor` in
[bench/aws/README.md](bench/aws/README.md).

## Sandbox provisioner

`cmd/ably-local-sandbox` is a test-app provisioner for the Ably SDK test suites
(see [DESIGN.md §15](DESIGN.md#15-sandbox-provisioner)). `ably-server`
itself is strictly single-app, but SDK test suites expect a sandbox host
that hands out a fresh app per run; `ably-local-sandbox` bridges the gap by
spawning one isolated, in-memory `ably-server` child per provisioned app:

- `POST /apps` takes an Ably test-app-setup `post_apps` body (keys,
  namespaces, channels) and boots a child for it, returning the app JSON
  extended with `endpoint`/`port`/`tls` so a client can connect straight
  to the child.
- `DELETE /apps/{appId}` tears that child down (idempotent).

```sh
go build -o ably-server ./cmd/ably-server
go build -o ably-local-sandbox ./cmd/ably-local-sandbox

./ably-local-sandbox --listen :9080 --server-bin ./ably-server
```

Children are always booted with the stats stub enabled
(`--enable-stats-stub`), since compat suites POST stats fixtures before
reading them back, but the core server leaves that stub off by default.
Run `ably-local-sandbox --help` for the full flag list (idle-TTL, log
directory/level, etc).

Point an SDK test suite's sandbox host at `http://localhost:9080` to run
it against local infrastructure instead of Ably's hosted sandbox.

## Status
